          With over 50 years of cooking experience we present you India with a
          fresh new look, with a creative menu offering a blend of contemporary
          and traditional home favorites, a home kitchen straight from the heart
          of a mother - daughter duo.
          <br />
          <br />
          It all started with experiments with food at home to kitty parties to
          wider functions for extended family and then swiftly growing the dream
          into a reality aka our own restaurant! We always aim to bring a fresh,
          creative, nutritious, tasty, and a balanced meal. We are progressive
          with our cuisine and not bound by the 'same-old' mentality as we are
          the Change- makers and by the service of our food we are breaking the
          shackles of misogyny, serving and treating everyone with equality with
          a bigger goal of building a better world.
          <br />
